# PracticalWork – Advanced Data Structures Antenna Project

## Overview

This project implements the solution for the “Advanced Data Structures” (EDA) course practical assignment at IPCA.  
It models a city’s antenna network, analyzes dangerous electromagnetic interference zones according to specified rules,
and provides both linked-list and graph-based analysis. The solution is modular, testable, and fully documented with
Doxygen.

## Features

- **Loads antenna maps** from files of arbitrary size and content
- **Dynamic linked list** management for antenna information and dangerous points
- **Graph-based modeling** for advanced operations (DFS, BFS, path finding)
- **Dangerous point calculation** following project rules (frequency alignment and distance)
- **Finds intersections** between dangerous zones generated by different frequencies
- **Interactive CLI menu** for all core operations
- **Modular source code** with clean separation of logic and UI
- **Doxygen documentation** for all modules and functions
- **Test scenarios** and sample input files included

## Requirements

- **C Compiler** (e.g., gcc, clang, MSVC)
- **CMake** (build system)
- **Doxygen** (for documentation generation)

## Build & Run

### 1. Build the Project

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
````

### 2. Run the Program

```sh
./PracticalWork
```

Or (on Windows):

```sh
PracticalWork.exe
```

### 3. Documentation

To generate Doxygen documentation:

```sh
doxygen Doxyfile
```

## How to Use

1. **Load an antenna map:**
   Load from provided `.txt` file, or create your own (see “Input Format”).

2. **Menu Operations:**

    * List all antennas
    * Add/remove antennas
    * Detect and list dangerous points
    * Switch between linked-list and graph views
    * Run DFS/BFS traversals
    * Find all paths between antennas
    * Find intersections between dangerous zones of two different frequencies

3. **Save and load operations:**
   You can persist data for later analysis.

## Input Format

Antenna map files are simple text grids:

```
..a...b
.a.a.b.
..a.b..
...b...
.c.c.c.
..b.b..
....c..
```

* Each cell: `.` for empty, `a`, `b`, `c`... for antennas with that frequency

## Assignment Compliance

* Both linked-list and graph approaches implemented
* Dangerous points are calculated according to pairwise antenna alignment and 2x distance rule
* DFS/BFS and all graph operations required are supported
* Intersections between zones for two frequencies are calculated
* Doxygen documentation is included and up to date
