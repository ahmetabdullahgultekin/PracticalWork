# Output Folder

## Overview

The `output` folder contains all the output files generated by the Antenna Mapping project. These files include the
saved antenna configurations and the calculated effect positions.

## File Structure

- `output/`: Directory containing all output files.

## Output File Format

Each output file follows a specific format to ensure consistency and ease of processing:

- The file contains a matrix where dots (`.`) represent empty spaces and characters represent antennas.
- Each row of the matrix is on a new line.
- The matrix is rectangular, meaning all rows have the same number of columns.

### Example

```
. . A . .
. B . . .
. . . C .
. . . . D
```

In this example:

- `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are antennas.
- `.` represents empty spaces.

## Usage

1. The program generates output files when saving antennas or effect positions.
2. The files are automatically placed in the `output` folder.
3. Ensure the files follow the specified format for consistency.
